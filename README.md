# Nilo - Password Manager
Nilo is a software developed with the aim of being a safe and practical password manager to use on a daily basis. It is able to create passwords (as well as store existing passwords) and encrypt them in a txt file.

It's been designed so that simplicity and effectiveness are the focus: Start the application, enter your "combination", double click on the correct entry and the password is now on the clipboard, ready to paste.]

Nilo has its own encryption method, based on the Ceasar Cipher, and the change of characters by codes.

Fun fact: The software design was inspired on my black cat called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nilojorel/"> Nilo </a> :)
