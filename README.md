# Password Manager - No name yet :(

The intention of this project is to develop a password manager that creates an individual encrypted database for each account created in the program. It will have functions for adding existing passwords, as well as for creating random passwords.

## Features

- Script for generate random passwords.
- Script to do the encryptation. In this script there are two different types of encryptation, they are:
  - Caesar Cipher: Basically, it takes the index of a desire letter on alphabet and by default adds 7  more to the index, and them, catch the letter that is in (index + 7). So if you want to encrypt "a" the return will be "h". 
  - My encode pattern: It takes a letter and turn into in encrypted code created by me(you can check the codes In "Password-Manager/MyEncodePattern.txt").
