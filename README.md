# Watchful Black Cat
This software creates a text file to safely save your passwords. It encrypts all generated data and then writes it all down to the first line of a text file that will have the name the user wants, for example: Chocolate cake recipe.

## Features

- Class to generate random passwords.
- Class to do the encryptation. In this class there are two different types of encryptation, they are:
  - Caesar Cipher: Basically, it takes the index of a desire letter on alphabet and by default adds 7  more to the index, and them, catch the letter that is in (index + 7). So if you want to encrypt "a" the return will be "h". 
  - My encode pattern: It takes a letter and turn into in encrypted code created by me(you can check the codes In "Password-Manager-All files/Documents/Encode pattern.txt").
- Login form.
- Register form.
- Passwords list form.
- Generator password form.
